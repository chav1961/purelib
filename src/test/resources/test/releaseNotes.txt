The most important difference for the release 0.0.4 is a migration to Java 9 functionality. All the Pure Library project was incapsulated into Java 9 module (named chav1961.purelib).

I. New features

1. All special URLs implementation in the Pure library were successfully migrated to Java 9 SPI support  

2. Class basic.ClassLoaderWrapper has been removed from the project because it's functionality can't be implemented in Java 9 correctly.

	- .line - insert LineNumberTable into generating Java class
	- .version - support versions of the Java class file format (1.7 and 1.8 are available now)
	- .varTable - insert LocalVarTable attribute into generating Java class
	- .source - insert source attribute into generating Java class

4. Byte code assembler got extended syntax check on stack manipulation commands
