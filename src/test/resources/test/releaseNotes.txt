Release 0.0.4 notes

General notes

The most important difference for the release 0.0.4 is a migration to Java 9 functionality. All the Pure Library project was incapsulated into Java 9 module (named chav1961.purelib).
As a result, many classes of the Pure Library were moved to packages, different to previous release and/or change it's content and implementation.

I. New features

1. Byte code assembler supports a set of new directives now:
	- .line - insert LineNumberTable into generating Java class
	- .version - support versions of the Java class file format (1.7 and 1.8 are available now)
	- .varTable - insert LocalVarTable attribute into generating Java class
	- .source - insert source attribute into generating Java class
	
2. Byte code assembler supports generation of <clinit> method and ConstValue attributes for static final fields now.	

II. Refactoring

1. All special URLs implementation in the Pure library were successfully migrated to Java 9 SPI support  

2. To prevent some kind of errors on assembler byte code generation, strong data type and stack manipulation check was implemented in it.

3. Performance of the byte code assembler and macro assembler were increased

III. Incompatibilities

1. Class basic.ClassLoaderWrapper was removed from Pure Library, because it's functionality can't be implemented in Java 9 and higher. 

IV. Bug fix

1. Macro assembler .choise with booleans fixed
2. AndOrTree last character in node name had been lost on walking fixed.
