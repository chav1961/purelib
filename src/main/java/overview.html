<p>Pure library is a collection of different packages and classes, that can be used in Java projects. This library is based on Java
JRE only and doesn't use any third-party libraries. It was one of the main goals when this library was developing. In the most of cases,
it's classes are oriented to maximal performance, so many of them have an old-styled program code. They also oriented to use standard
Java mechanisms, protocols and so on...</p>
<h2>Library content</h2>
<h3>chav1961.purelib.basic package</h3>
<p>This package contains classes to simplify quick parsers development and to simplify development of the console-oriented stand-alone applications.
It contains a 'pluggable' class loader to implement easy-to-use plugin mechanism in your applications, a class, that simplified processing of the 
console commands (it parses console command according to it's syntax, finds appropriative command processor and execute it), a set of logger facades
(because of the <b>ZOO</b> of the logger projects, that is a real problem now). It also contains 'smart' Property class, that supports property 
substitutions and automatic data type conversions, some classes that can be used in quick parsers (including quick tree to manipulate lexemas and names)
ûand quick character reader for line-by-line data processing. A special utility class supports some usable functions in the programming practice.</p>    
<h3>chav1961.purelib.growablearrays package</h3>
<p>This package supports a set of <i>growable</i> arrays to use in the quick parsers. It usability is specialized on the well-known task: quick filling
of the array's content with the data and longer using them as 'constant' data. Differ to {@link java.util.List} functionality, growable arrays supports
only primitive types without any wrapping.</p> 
<h3>chav1961.purelib.fsys package</h3>
<p>This package supports a 'File system' abstractions for the different kings of it's 'substrate'. This concept is similar to File system concept in the
Java 1.7, but extends it to the wide range of data stores: files and file systems, RMI connections, URL-based connections, database content and so on. In
the extension of the pure library you can find a lot of the additional 'file system' implementations. File systems also supports Linux-styled <i>mounting</i>,
that allow you to make heterogenous file system tree to use it in your program.</p>   
<h3>chav1961.purelib.i18n package</h3>
<p>This package supports concept of the <i>multilingual</i> strings.</p>
<h3>chav1961.purelib.streams package</h3>
<p>This package supports Java I/O concept of the streams. The 'root' package contains class, that supports stream parsing of the JSON content by XML SAX style.
It also contains utility class to build JSON SAX-style handlers for quick-and-simple deserialization JSON content into Java classes</p>
<p>Subpackages of this package contain different kind of the streams-convertors. Main idea of them is to make on-the-fly conversion from data written
from one format to another. All the streams are 'ordinal' I/O streams and don't require a special case to use. Subpackages contain a markdown--&gt;HTML converotr,
Creole--&gt;HTML convertor, and also <b>Java bytecode Assembler</b>, that converts assembly byte code to byte[], containing class description for use with 
{@link java.lang.ClassLoader#defineClass(String,byte[],int,int)} method</p>
