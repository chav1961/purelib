	<p>Pure Library is a collection of different packages and classes,
		that can be used in Java projects. This library is based on Java JRE
		only and doesn't use any third-party libraries. It was one of the main
		goals when this library was developing. In the most of cases, it's
		classes are oriented to maximal performance, so many of them have an
		old-styled program code. They also oriented to use standard Java
		mechanisms, protocols and so on...</p>

		package
	</h3>
	<p>
		This package contains classes to simplify quick parsers development
		and to simplify development of the console-oriented stand-alone
		applications. It contains a 'pluggable' class loader to implement
		easy-to-use plugin mechanism in your applications, a class, that
		simplified processing of the console commands (it parses console
		command according to it's syntax, finds appropriative command
		processor and execute it), a set of logger facades (because of the <b>ZOO</b>
		of the logger projects, that is a real problem now). It also contains
		'smart' Property class, that supports property substitutions and
		automatic data type conversions, some classes that can be used in
		quick parsers (including quick tree to manipulate lexemas and names)
		ûand quick character reader for line-by-line data processing. A
		special utility class supports some usable functions in the
		programming practice.

		<a href="chav1961/purelib/concurrent/package-summary.html">chav1961.purelib.concurrent</a>

	<p>This package contains some useful classes to use in the
		concurrent programming</p>

		<a href="chav1961/purelib/basic/growablearrays/package-summary.html">chav1961.purelib.growablearrays</a>
		package
	</h3>
	<p>
		This package supports a set of <i>growable</i> arrays to use in the
		quick parsers and other tasks. It usability is specialized on the
		well-known task: quick filling of the array's content with the data
		and longer using them as 'constant' data. Since 0.0.2, they also
		supports dynamic growing/shrinking and can be used an general
		resizable arrays. Differ to {@link java.util.List} functionality,
		growable arrays supports only primitive types without any wrapping.
	</p>
	<h3>
		<a href="chav1961/purelib/fsys/package-summary.html">chav1961.purelib.fsys</a>
		package
	</h3>
	<p>
		This package supports a 'File system' abstractions for the different
		kings of it's 'substrate'. This concept is similar to File system
		concept in the Java 1.7, but extends it to the wide range of data
		stores: files and file systems, RMI connections, URL-based
		connections, database content and so on. In the extension of the pure
		library you can find a lot of the additional 'file system'
		implementations. File systems also supports Linux-styled <i>mounting</i>,
		that allow you to make heterogenous file system tree to use it in your
		program.

		<a href="chav1961/purelib/i18n/package-summary.html">chav1961.purelib.i18n</a>
		package
	</h3>
	<p>
		This package supports concept of the <i>multilingual</i> strings.
	</p>
	<h3>
		<a href="chav1961/purelib/streams/package-summary.html">chav1961.purelib.streams</a>
		package
	</h3>
	<p>This package supports Java I/O concept of the streams. The
		'root' package contains class, that supports stream parsing of the
		JSON content by XML SAX style. It also contains utility class to build
		JSON SAX-style handlers for quick-and-simple deserialization JSON
		content into Java classes</p>
	<p>
		Subpackages of this package contain different kind of the
		streams-convertors. Main idea of them is to make on-the-fly conversion
		from data written from one format to another. All the streams are
		'ordinal' I/O streams and don't require a special case to use.
		Subpackages contain a markdown--&gt;HTML converotr, Creole--&gt;HTML
		convertor, and also <b>Java bytecode Assembler</b>, that converts
		assembly byte code to byte[], containing class description for use
		with {@link java.lang.ClassLoader#defineClass(String,byte[],int,int)
		defineClass(String,byte[],int,int)} method

	<h3>Generally</h3>
	<p>
		To unify checking rules for method's parameters, a more specific
		{@link java.lang.NullPointerException NullPointerException}, {@link
		java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
		ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException} are used now instead of {@link
		java.lang.IllegalArgumentException IllegalArgumentException} in the
		method's parameters checking code. A new package <a
			href="chav1961/purelib/basic/xsd/package-summary.html">chav1961.purelib.basic.xsd</a>
		package was created to keep and allow access with the different XSD
		schemes in the Pure Library. Package <a
			href="chav1961/purelib/i18n/package-summary.html">chav1961.purelib.i18n</a>
		was fully refactored. Also some bugs detected were fixed
	</p>

	<h3>
		<a href="chav1961/purelib/basic/package-summary.html">chav1961.purelib.basic</a>
		package
	</h3>
	<p>Some useful classes were added to the package:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>{@link chav1961.purelib.basic.PureLibSettings
			PureLibSettings} class to support global settings for Pure Library
			classes. This settings can be controlled with the <b>-Dpurelib.settings.source</b>
			variable on the JVM starting
		</li>
		<li>{@link chav1961.purelib.basic.ReusableInstances
			ReusableInstances} class to support C/C++ malloc()/free() programming
			style to reuse allocated instances of the class</li>

		were made in it:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>a new useful method {@link
			chav1961.purelib.basic.growablearrays.GrowableCharArray#length(int)
			length(int)} was added to all classes in the package</li>
		<li>a deep refactoring of all the classes was made to support
			growing/shrinking of the array content and increase it's performance</li>

			chav1961.purelib.basic.growablearrays.GrowableByteArray
			GrowableByteArray} class extended it's functionality with the {@link
			java.io.OutputStream} and {@link java.io.InputStream DataInputStream}</li>
		<li>{@link
			chav1961.purelib.basic.growablearrays.GrowableCharArray

			java.io.Reader Reader} and {@link java.io.Writer Writer}</li>
		<li>a new {@link
			chav1961.purelib.basic.growablearrays.InOutGrowableByteArray

			GrowableByteArray} functionality with the {@link
			java.io.DataOutputStream} and {@link java.io.DataInputStream
